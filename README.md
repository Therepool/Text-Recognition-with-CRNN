# Text-Recognition-with-CRNN

This repository includes my work on creating a system that recognizes and predicts the text on a text image.

To use the system, follow these steps:

1. download the files here
2. set an appropiate environment and download requirements (requirements.txt)
3. download the MJSynth dataset: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/#sec-synth
4. run 'main.py' to create the CRNN model
5. run 'application.py' or 'userInterface.py' to have a GUI to test the model with

The folder with images can be used to test the model, or just use images from the downloaded database

The image must be in jpg form, and only contain text for it to be recognized properly.
